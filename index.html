        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a 
        muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck 
        and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is 
        sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight 
        range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for the former and 120 to 182 kg 
        (265 to 400 lb) for the latter. Male lions have a prominent mane, which 
        is the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of 
        a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions 
        typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The species 
        is an apex and keystone predator, although they scavenge when opportunities 
        occur. Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species 
        typically does not.</p>
